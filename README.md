# Bikelane Final Exam Project - React App

**Description:**

Bikelane is a React web application designed to host a variety of bike-related events catering to both beginners and veteran bikers. The project was part of my final exam, and I was provided with the design and backend, including the necessary data, by my teacher.

### Key Points:

- **Design and Backend Provided:** My teacher supplied the project with a pre-existing design and a backend containing the necessary data.
  
- **Events for All Skill Levels:** Bikelane aims to bring together bike enthusiasts of all skill levels, offering events suitable for both beginners and experienced bikers.

- **Limited Timeframe:** With a strict deadline of 7 days, I had to implement the entire project, including frontend development. Unfortunately, the written documentation, as well as the backend, is not included in this Git repository.

- **Backend Challenges:** While the backend functionality is in place, some data inconsistencies exist. Texts might be misplaced, and some images are missing. Despite these challenges, the overall functionality of the application remains intact.

- **Ongoing Fixes:** Post-submission, efforts are ongoing to rectify the backend discrepancies. I acknowledge that certain information may not be in its intended place, but the core functionality of the application is maintained.

**Note:** This README does not include the written documentation; however, the application is expected to function as intended.


Feel free to explore the app, and your feedback is greatly appreciated!
